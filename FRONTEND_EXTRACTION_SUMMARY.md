# Progress Accountants Frontend Extraction - Complete Package

## ✅ Extraction Strategy

**Files Successfully Prepared:**

- Complete service offerings and business identity
- Professional page content and styling
- Skeleton loading animations

## ✅ Frontend Structure
```
client/src/          → Extract as root src/
client/public/       → Extract as public/
attached_assets/     → Extract as assets/
All CSS/styling      → Maintained
All components       → No backend dependencies
```

## ✅ Key Modifications Required

1. **API Configuration**: Update hooks to use `VITE_API_URL` environment variable
2. **Navigation**: Remove admin/backend links, add "Demo Site" labeling  
3. **Authentication**: Handle unauthenticated state gracefully
4. **Build Process**: Static site generation only
