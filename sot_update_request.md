# Blueprint Management System - SOT Update Request

## Implementation Summary
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive Blueprint Management System for Progress Accountants that enables the creation, extraction, and cloning of system templates. This system is a critical component of our platform's enterprise deployment strategy.

## Key Components Implemented

### Database Schema
- Created blueprint_templates table for storing template metadata
- Implemented clone_operations table to track instance creation
- Added blueprint_exports table to store versioned extraction data

### Server Controller
- Built a robust blueprintController with complete CRUD operations
- Added tenant-agnostic data extraction functionality 
- Implemented cloning logic that properly preserves SOT declarations
- Added secure authentication and role-based authorization

### Frontend Interface
- Designed a modern BlueprintManagementPage with Shadcn UI components
- Created tabbed interface for Templates, Clone Operations, and Exports
- Implemented dialog-based forms for template creation and cloning
- Added extract functionality with agnostic option for tenant independence

## Verification Steps
- All API endpoints are operational and tested
- Created test template and verified storage in database
- Tested extraction endpoint and confirmed proper data formatting
- Implemented proper integration with AdminSidebar

## SOT Update Request
Please update the SOT to reflect the new Blueprint Management System capabilities in this instance. The system is ready to be registered as a core component with the following specifications:

- Component: Blueprint Management System
- Version: 1.0.0
- Status: Active
- Capabilities: Template Creation, Blueprint Extraction, Instance Cloning
- Requirements: Admin or Super Admin role access

The system follows the tenant isolation model while supporting cross-tenant operations for authorized super administrators.

## Additional Notes
The implementation is complete and functional. The next phase would involve integrating with the Vault for centralized template storage and implementing post-clone validation.
