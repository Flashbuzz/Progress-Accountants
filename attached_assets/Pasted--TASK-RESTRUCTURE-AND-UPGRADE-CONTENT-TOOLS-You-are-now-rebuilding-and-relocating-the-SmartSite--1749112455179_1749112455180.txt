📝 TASK: RESTRUCTURE AND UPGRADE CONTENT TOOLS

You are now rebuilding and relocating the SmartSite Blog and Social Generators under the new `Insights & Content` zone.

📁 NEW ROUTES & COMPONENTS

1. 📝 Blog Generator
- Route: `/admin/content/blog-posts`
- Component: `BlogPostGenerator.tsx`

2. 📣 Social Generator

These tools should be accessible via `/admin/insights` and the dashboard `/admin/dashboard`.
