Prompt 1: Onboarding Overview + Build Mandatory Homepage Screen

Context for Replit:

We’re building a structured onboarding flow inside the Progress Accountants Replit instance, which will become the master template for all future client instances of the NextMonth system.

The onboarding flow is split into three phases:
	1.	Non-skippable setup (homepage first)
	2.	Foundation pages (about, services, contact, etc.)
	3.	Launch + free build mode (access to marketplace and custom tools)

Your job is to build each screen as a modular UI component with clear structure, reusable inputs, and stored system context.

Your First Task (Prompt 1.1): Build the Mandatory Homepage Setup Screen

⸻

Screen Name: homepage-setup

Screen Purpose:

This is the first real onboarding screen and it cannot be skipped. It collects the essential content needed to generate the user’s homepage—either now or later through AI.

Once this form is complete, it updates a system object called project_context.homepage which is referenced across the platform (preview tools, generators, builders).

⸻

Layout:

1. Header Area

Welcome to your Homepage Setup
This is the first step in your Growth System. Let’s define the key message your website will deliver.

2. Form Section (stacked cards or grouped blocks)
	•	Headline
“What’s the bold first thing visitors should read?”
	•	Subheading / Supporting Line
	•	Core Offer or Promise
e.g. “Tax support for UK-based creatives”
	•	Business Benefits (up to 3)
	•	Fast turnaround
	•	Expert advice
	•	Local support
	•	Primary Call to Action (CTA)
e.g. “Book a Call”
	•	Hero Image or Video Upload (optional)
	•	Layout/Style Preset Selector
e.g. “Modern”, “Classic”, “Bold” – just a dropdown for now

⸻

3. Buttons
	•	[ Save Homepage ]
	•	[ Preview Draft ] (uses stored context to simulate output)
	•	No skip button allowed.

⸻

Storage Instructions:

All form inputs should update this object:

project_context.homepage = {
  headline: "",
  subheading: "",
  offer: "",
  benefits: [],
  cta_text: "",
  media_url: "",
  layout_style: ""
}

Use this as a shared object across preview and generation tools.

⸻

Design Notes:
	•	Clean and confidence-inspiring UI
	•	Group inputs logically, with clear labels
	•	Show light instructions or examples inline
	•	Save button should validate required fields

⸻

Next Step (After Completion):

Once this screen is complete, user is redirected to the Foundation Pages Overview (Prompt 2).
