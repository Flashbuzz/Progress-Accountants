Helping You Stay on Top of Royalties, Tax, and Touring Finances—Without Missing a Beat

Intro Text:
From independent artists and producers to recording studios and music labels, we support your creative journey with financial clarity and control. At Progress, we understand the rhythm of the music industry—and we build your finances to match it.

Section: Why Musicians and Music Businesses Choose Progress

1. Tax-Smart Royalty Management
Royalty income can be unpredictable—and heavily taxed if mismanaged. We help you plan for the peaks and troughs, stay compliant, and keep more of what you earn.

“Progress gave me total control of my royalty income. I finally feel in charge of my music money.”
— Independent Artist, Oxfordshire

2. Touring & International Tax Guidance
Gigging abroad? We make sure you’re covered with cross-border tax advice, travel expense planning, and currency-aware financial reporting.

3. Smooth Payments for Freelancers & Session Musicians
From bandmates to backing vocalists, we handle payments and tax filings for everyone in your crew—keeping you compliant and your collaborators happy.

4. Smart Studio & Equipment Expenses
We advise on how to buy, lease, and depreciate equipment in a way that maximises tax efficiency and supports long-term growth.
