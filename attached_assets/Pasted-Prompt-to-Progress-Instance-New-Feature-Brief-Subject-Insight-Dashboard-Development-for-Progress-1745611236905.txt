Prompt to Progress Instance – New Feature Brief

Subject: Insight Dashboard Development for Progress Client Site

⸻

Context:
The Progress client site already has a working lightweight Insights Gathering App.
The next step is to develop a full Insights Dashboard to support deeper engagement, tracking, and gamification of user insights.

⸻

Feature Requirements:

1. User Management:
	•	Admins must be able to set up and manage users who have access to the Insights App.
	•	Each user should have:
	•	A display name
	•	Role/position (optional field)
	•	Active/inactive status toggle

2. Insight Submission Tracking:
	•	The system must record who submits each insight (linked to user profile).
	•	It must timestamp each insight submission (date and time).

3. Gamification Features:
	•	The system must automatically track and display leaderboards showing:
	•	Top insight contributors on a daily, weekly, and monthly rolling basis.
	•	Leaderboards should:
	•	Show user name
	•	Number of insights submitted
	•	Optional: A small “trophy” icon or visual badge for the top contributor of each period.

4. AI Interpretation Layer (Phase 1):
	•	The dashboard should include an AI-generated summary each week and month:
	•	Identify common themes emerging from the insights submitted.
	•	Highlight most valuable or insightful submissions based on patterns like originality, frequency of certain keywords, or emotional weight.
	•	Summaries should be short, readable, and client-friendly (like a mini executive report).

⸻

Additional Notes:
	•	The daily/weekly/monthly tracking must be rolling — i.e., always showing the latest full 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days, not static calendar weeks or months.
	•	We are open to simple, clean visual elements (e.g., small bar charts or badges) but must keep the dashboard lightweight and easy to navigate.
	•	AI summaries should have a human-readable tone (friendly but professional), not a raw machine output.
	•	Future phases may expand to rewards or recognition features based on leaderboards, but that is not required for Phase 1.

⸻

Deliverables for this Phase:
	•	User access control for Insights App
	•	Insight tracking per user
	•	Daily, weekly, monthly leaderboards
	•	Weekly and monthly AI theme/summary generation
	•	Clean, lightweight Insights Dashboard UI

⸻

Success Criteria:
	•	Admin can add/edit users easily.
	•	Insight submission attribution is fully accurate.
	•	Leaderboards update automatically.
	•	AI summaries are relevant, readable, and refreshing weekly/monthly without manual intervention.

⸻

Tone and UX Reminder:
	•	Dashboard should feel motivating, rewarding, and easy to use.
	•	No unnecessary complexity — fast, visual, clear.
	•	Think “Progress is a place where insights matter, and people feel good contributing.”
