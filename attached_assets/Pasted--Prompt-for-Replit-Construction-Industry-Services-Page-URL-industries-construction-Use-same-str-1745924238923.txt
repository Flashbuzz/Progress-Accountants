Helping You Navigate CIS, VAT, and Cash Flow—So You Can Focus on Building

Intro Paragraph:
From one-man bands to regional contractors and property developers, Progress helps construction businesses take control of their finances. Whether you’re managing subcontractors, juggling projects, or scaling your team—we make the numbers work for you.

Why Construction Professionals Choose Progress

1. CIS Compliance Without the Headache
We handle the ins and outs of CIS tax deductions, monthly returns, and HMRC reporting—so you stay compliant and get paid on time.

“Progress keeps our CIS records spotless. It’s one less thing to worry about on site.”
— Construction Director, Banbury

2. VAT & Reverse Charge Simplified
The Construction Reverse Charge can be a minefield. We make sure your VAT is reclaimed correctly and that you’re never overpaying or filing late.

3. Stay On Top of Project Cash Flow
We help you track income and outgoings per project, forecast for slow months, and budget for materials, labour, and growth.

From setting up new company structures to managing payroll and financing large builds—we’re your strategic partner for growth, not just compliance.
