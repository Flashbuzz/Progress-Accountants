Prompt Title:
New Personal Entrepreneur Support Page (Solo Build Only)

Prompt Body:
Create a dedicated Personal Entrepreneur Support page for Solo Entrepreneur site clones.
This page is not available for Team site versions and must never expose private data publicly.

Core Components:

Entrepreneur News Feed

Live pull of trending articles and insights from the world of small business, startups, and entrepreneurship.

News should update dynamically or at regular intervals.

Sources can include curated APIs (e.g., Google News - Entrepreneurship category, RSS feeds, or equivalent).

Business Reflection and Support Journal

Allow entrepreneurs to log entries in multiple categories:

Thoughts

Feelings

Ideas

Challenges

Opportunities

Optional mood indicator or simple emoji/status alongside each entry.

Journal entries should be private and securely stored (admin-only access).

AI Contextual Analysis and Guidance

Run periodic AI analysis on journal entries to:

Detect mood, stress indicators, cognitive load trends.

Offer personalized, practical advice (e.g., time management tips, motivation, rest recommendations).

Acknowledge health, mental well-being, and financial realities sensitively and supportively.

Responses must feel empathetic and aligned with entrepreneurial challenges.

Private Context-Aware Companion Assistant

The admin-side Companion Assistant (private dashboard only) must have access to journal/AI analysis context.

Example: If stress or sadness is detected, the assistant could gently suggest breaks or encouragement (e.g., "Looks like youâ€™ve been carrying a lot lately. How about a 5-minute reset?").

Compartmentalization is critical: No private journal or AI analysis data can bleed into the public-facing Companion Assistant used on public pages.

Public Companion Assistant remains neutral and blind to personal data.

Critical Safeguards:

Journal and AI insight data must never be exposed outside of the logged-in admin dashboard.

Data Privacy Barrier must exist between:

Personal Entrepreneur Support Page (private use)

Public Website Pages (public use)

If necessary, separate Companion AI contexts should be defined internally to enforce strict separation of modes.

Activation Condition:

This page and companion behavior should only activate if the user selected "Solo Entrepreneur" mode at clone/setup.
