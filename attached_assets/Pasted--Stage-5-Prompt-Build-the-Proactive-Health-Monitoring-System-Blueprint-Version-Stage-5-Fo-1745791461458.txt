‚ú® Stage 5 Prompt: Build the Proactive Health Monitoring System (Blueprint Version)

‚∏ª

üéØ Stage 5 Focus

You will now:
	‚Ä¢	Build the first version of the Proactive Health Monitoring System
	‚Ä¢	It must work generically across all NextMonth Blueprint client sites
	‚Ä¢	The goal is to detect system issues automatically before users even raise a support ticket
	‚Ä¢	If issues are detected, trigger:
	‚Ä¢	Preemptive user-friendly messages
	‚Ä¢	Admin alerts to Rob (only when necessary)

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Tasks for Stage 5

‚∏ª

1. Set Up Health Monitoring Service

Service	Purpose
/services/health-monitor	Continuously runs background checks across key system areas

This service must run lightweight, non-intrusive system checks at regular intervals.

‚∏ª

2. Define Core Health Metrics to Monitor

Metric	Purpose	Trigger
API Error Rates	Monitor failures on critical routes (/media-upload, /bookings, /portal)	Spike in 5xx errors within 5 min
Dashboard Load Times	Monitor page load performance (>3s = problem)	Slowdown detected
User Session Failures	Monitor failed logins, session expirations	Spike detected
Media Upload Failures	Monitor % of uploads failing	Crosses threshold (>10%)

You can start with these 4 key areas and expand modularly later.

‚∏ª

3. Automated Preemptive Messaging

When a problem is detected:
	‚Ä¢	Send cinematic but reassuring user message at the affected area:

Example:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre refreshing part of the system to ensure optimal performance.
Please retry shortly ‚Äî everything‚Äôs under active care.‚Äù

Do NOT blame the user or overexpose system complexity.

‚∏ª

4. Internal Admin Alerts

When a problem crosses critical threshold:
	‚Ä¢	Notify Admin (Rob) via Admin Panel dashboard widget or simple internal alert

Example Alert Message:

‚Äú‚ö° Health Alert:
API Errors on /media-upload route have exceeded safe thresholds.
Impact detected for 12 users.
Monitoring active.‚Äù

‚∏ª

5. Monitoring Reporting UI (Optional for Bonus)

Create a small /admin/system-health view:
	‚Ä¢	Shows recent health events
	‚Ä¢	Auto-clears resolved incidents after 24 hours
	‚Ä¢	Provides historical trend view (lightweight)

‚∏ª

üìú Visual UX Notes

Element	Style
User-Facing Preemptive Messages	Minimal, cinematic overlays (no ugly popups)
Admin Alerts	Calm notifications inside Admin Panel (not push notifications yet)
Health Dashboard (Optional)	Soft trend graphs, simple incident list



‚∏ª

‚úÖ Completion Confirmation

When Stage 5 is complete, output:

{
  "status": "Support System Stage 5 Completed",
  "proactive_health_monitoring_operational": "true",
  "user_preemptive_messaging_operational": "true",
  "admin_alerts_operational": "true"
}

Await Stage 6 instructions before proceeding.

‚∏ª

üß† Ratplet Reminders
	‚Ä¢	NEVER panic the user. Even serious errors must feel cinematic and under control.
	‚Ä¢	Monitor core user paths first: Uploads, Logins, Portal Access.
	‚Ä¢	Modularize health checks so more can be added easily in future (e.g., CDN delays, DB slowdowns).
