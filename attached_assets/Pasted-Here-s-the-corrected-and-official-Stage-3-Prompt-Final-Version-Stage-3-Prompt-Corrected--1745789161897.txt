Here’s the corrected and official Stage 3 Prompt (Final Version):

⸻

✨ Stage 3 Prompt (Corrected): Build the Self-Resolving Ticket Engine (Blueprint Version)

⸻

🎯 Stage 3 Focus

You will now:
	•	Build the generic Self-Resolving Ticket Engine
	•	It must be blueprint-compatible across all NextMonth client sites, including but not limited to Progress Accountants
	•	Allow users to report structured issues
	•	Attempt self-resolution of common problems automatically
	•	Escalate to admin (Rob) only if necessary

⸻

⚡ Important Context

This Ticket Engine was originally discussed while reviewing the Progress Accountants client site.
However, this Ticket Engine must be designed generically for the full NextMonth Blueprint so it can be reused across all sites.

✅ Do not hard-code client-specific logic (like Progress-only categories).
✅ Build with modular issue types and dynamic context awareness per client instance.

⸻

🛠️ Tasks for Stage 3

⸻

1. Create Self-Resolving Ticket Form (at /support/ticket)

Header:

Need Help? Let’s Solve It Together.

⸻

Structured Questions (Generic Blueprint Version):

Field	Purpose
What were you trying to do?	Free text
Which part of the system were you using?	Dynamic Dropdown (autogenerates from active tools/pages detected)
Did you see an error message?	Yes/No (If yes, open small text field to enter error)
Which device are you on?	Dropdown: Desktop / Tablet / Mobile
Have you tried refreshing or reloading the page?	Yes/No



⸻

2. Dynamic Self-Resolution Logic

After submission:
	•	AI reads context
	•	If common patterns detected → suggest instant solutions

Issue Trigger	Suggested Self-Fix
Media Upload Problem	“Try reducing file size or switching to desktop device.”
Booking or Calendar Issue	“Refresh browser, clear cache, check if adblocker is interfering.”
Page Content Editing Issue	“Try saving as draft first before publishing live changes.”
User Login Trouble	“Reset your password using [Forgot Password] link.”

User Options:
	•	[Problem Solved, Thank You]
	•	[Still Need Help → Escalate]

⸻

3. Escalation Handling

If escalation needed:
	•	Save structured session and ticket
	•	Route to Admin Support Panel
	•	Notify Rob/admin with full ticket context

⸻

4. Ticket Confirmation UX

When ticket is submitted:

Thank You — We’re On It!

Your issue has been logged.
We’ll review and respond as soon as possible.

[Return to Dashboard] button.

⸻

📜 Visual UX Notes

Element	Style
Ticket Form	Professional, clean card layout
Auto-Suggestions	Fade in smoothly after structured data submission
Escalation Flow	Calm, professional tone — no “panic” feeling
Loading States	Micro-animations (no spinning wheels of death)



⸻

✅ Completion Confirmation

When Stage 3 is complete, output:

{
  "status": "Support System Stage 3 Completed",
  "self_resolving_ticket_engine_functional": "true",
  "blueprint_generic_scope_confirmed": "true",
  "automatic_fix_suggestions_operational": "true",
  "structured_ticket_capture_operational": "true"
}

Await Stage 4 instructions before proceeding.

⸻

🧠 Ratplet Reminders
	•	Ticket system must stay generic and modular, pulling system context dynamically.
	•	Must work for Progress, NextMonth Home, Beta Sites, Future Clients — no hard-coded assumptions.
	•	Build so that site-specific issues can easily be added later via config (not by modifying core code).

⸻

✨ End of Corrected Stage 3 Prompt
