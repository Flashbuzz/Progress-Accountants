✨ Master Build Prompt: NextMonth Concierge Onboarding Journey (Replit Build)

⸻

🎬 Introduction

You are tasked with building the NextMonth Concierge Onboarding System.

This system is cinematic, premium, and user-guided, designed to help new clients set up their Smart Sites through an intelligent, self-paced journey — without human handholding until launch.

You will receive instructions broken into stages.
Each stage must be completed cleanly before moving to the next.

⸻

🛠️ Staging Structure

You will follow these stages:

Stage	Focus
Stage 1	System Overview + Build Foundation (base routes, components, progress handling)
Stage 2	Account Creation Module (Magic Link + SSO login flow)
Stage 3	Foundations Discovery Flow (initial questions: business type, team size, urgency)
Stage 4	Concierge Split Flow (DIY Minimal Site or Professional Pages Intake)
Stage 5	Professional Pages Guided Intake (pages, design feel, typography, colors, inspiration)
Stage 6	Launch Profile Generation + Admin Summary Panel
Stage 7	Auto-Generated Concierge Summary Email
Stage 8	Review, Polish, Final UX Enhancements (progress saving, soft animations, accessibility)



⸻

📦 Stage 1 Instructions (Begin Here)

Goal:
Set up the foundation for the Concierge Journey system.

You must:

1. Create the base structure:
	•	/onboarding/start — Landing welcome screen
	•	/onboarding/flow — Main onboarding journey router
	•	/onboarding/complete — Final confirmation screen

⸻

2. Build the Progress Handler
	•	Create a simple Progress Manager that saves:
	•	Current stage
	•	Completed sections
	•	Basic answers in session or database (using a clean object structure)

Example:

{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "current_stage": "foundations_discovery",
  "answers": {
    "business_type": "Consulting",
    "team_size": "Solo",
    "urgency": "2–4 weeks"
  }
}



⸻

3. Set up Initial Welcome Screen (/onboarding/start)

Content should be:

⸻

Welcome to NextMonth

You’re about to design the future of your business.
This isn’t just a website — it’s the foundation of your next decade of growth.

Let’s build it, step by step.
[Start Your Journey]

⸻

	•	Clicking [Start Your Journey] should route them to /onboarding/flow.

⸻

4. Confirm When Ready
	•	When Stage 1 is complete, output a simple JSON confirmation:

{
  "status": "Stage 1 Completed",
  "routes_created": ["/onboarding/start", "/onboarding/flow", "/onboarding/complete"],
  "progress_manager": "initialized"
}

	•	Await further instructions before starting Stage 2.

⸻

🧠 Reminders
	•	Design everything cinematically and minimally (this is a premium system).
	•	Maintain progress saving between sessions.
	•	All content must be structured cleanly — no messy strings, no duplicated routes.
	•	Respond cleanly and await the next stage prompt after Stage 1.

⸻

✅ Final Note for Ratplet:

This onboarding journey must feel like a VIP client experience —
not just a signup form.
Every screen, every choice, every step must feel crafted and alive.

You will be guided through every stage carefully.

Begin with Stage 1.
