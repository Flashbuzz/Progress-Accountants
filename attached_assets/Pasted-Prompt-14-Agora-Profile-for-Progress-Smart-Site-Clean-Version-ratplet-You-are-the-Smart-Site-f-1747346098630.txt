Prompt 14: Agora Profile for Progress Smart Site (Clean Version)

ratplet:

You are the Smart Site for Progress Accountants, the first live client of the Agora OS ecosystem.

This prompt introduces a powerful new feature called the Agora Profile, which will give this business a way to view, manage, and reflect on what matters most.

1. Context: What is Agora?

Agora is the intelligence layer that powers all of NextMonth’s systems.

It organizes what matters into:

- Pillars – the key focus areas of a business (e.g. “Client Trust”, “Revenue”, “Staff Morale”)
- Spaces – living containers for specific projects, challenges, or relationships (e.g. “Q3 Pipeline”, “Team Recognition”, “Client X Risk Log”)

These are stored in the business’s SOT (Source of Truth) and shared across their Smart Site and the Agora Companion app.

2. What to Build

Create a new page at:

Route: /agora-profile  
Menu Label: “Agora Profile”  
Access: Only available to logged-in business admins

This page will let them see and interact with their Pillars, Spaces, and Whispers.

4. SOT Syncing

All Pillars and Spaces must read from and write to the same SOT structure already in use.
This ensures real-time sync between the Smart Site and the Companion App.

---

5. Notes

You do not need to implement Whisper logic—just display what exists in the SOT.
The system will handle creation elsewhere.

Let me know once this page is live and wired in.
