Rapplet Build Prompt: NextMonth Dynamic Navigation System

⸻

High-Level Vision

We are not building a typical SaaS dashboard.
We are building the future of full-stack business operating platforms — where business owners create, manage, grow, and evolve their entire ecosystem from one cinematic, empowering interface.

The navigation system must reflect that.

⸻

Navigation Goals
	1.	Multiple Intuitive Navigation Modes:
	•	Offer a primary grouped sidebar with intelligent, cinematic categorization.
	•	Offer an optional floating Quick Select Menu where users can pin their favorite or most-used tools/pages, like a “command center widget.”
	•	Both modes should be visually elegant, low-clutter, and performance-optimized.
	2.	Intelligent Grouping of Menu Items:
Group tools/pages into meaningful categories that speak to the user’s mindset and journey, not just technical functions. Example categories:

Group	Examples
Creator Tools	Insights, Blog, Social Posts, Media Manager
Admin Tools	Profile, Billing, Business Settings
Page Builders	Homepage, Foundation Pages, Smart Publisher
Personal Growth	Achievements, Challenges, Goals
Marketplace Access	Browse and install advanced Tools

(These group names are just examples; innovation is encouraged.)

	3.	Marketplace Visibility and Integration:
	•	The Marketplace must never be hidden deep in submenus.
	•	It should have its own prominent menu item.
	•	Every basic tool (e.g., the default Blog tool) should have an embedded CTA:
	•	Example: “Want more power? Explore Advanced Blog Tools in the Marketplace.”
	4.	Gamified Discovery:
	•	Unlocking new tools should feel exciting.
	•	Small badges like “New!” or “Recommended for You” can appear on Marketplace items.
	•	Consider offering limited-time rewards for installing or using tools.

Interface Concepts (optional, if you want to innovate)
	•	Quick Access Wheel: A radial, floating menu (activated by a hotkey or button) that spins up pinned tools.
	•	Adaptive Sidebar: Sidebar shrinks into icons when not used, expands on hover.
	•	Profile-Driven Menu Suggestions: As users build more pages or tools, suggest upgrades or next actions intelligently.
	•	Theme-Aware UI: Menus should adapt to dark/light mode and the user’s brand colors subtly.

⸻

Technical Notes
	•	Must retrieve active Pages and Tools dynamically from the user’s deployment manifest.
	•	Allow users to pin/unpin Quick Selection tools without refreshing the page.
	•	Animations must be fast, minimalistic, and purposeful — no unnecessary bloat.
	•	Core navigation must remain stable even if the user’s toolset changes frequently.

⸻

Deliverables
	•	An intelligent, cinematic navigation system
	•	Dynamic, grouped sidebar
	•	Optional floating Quick Select Menu (pin tools/pages)
	•	Marketplace placed prominently
	•	Embedded CTAs in each basic tool promoting advanced upgrades
	•	Smooth, gamified discovery of new features

Mindset Reminder for the Developer

You are building the cockpit of the future of business ownership.
Every click should feel empowering.
Every discovery should feel exciting.
Every interaction should be fluid, intuitive, and cinematic.

✅ Output Expectation

A full onboarding and navigation experience that feels like a living platform, not just a list of pages.
