Hi Replit 👋

Please create a new screen in this project called:

Module Gallery
(alternative name: “Available Tools” or “Feature Library” — feel free to stylize it)

⸻

📦 Purpose:

Let users browse and request prebuilt screens/modules that have already been scoped and designed inside the main NextMonth platform.

This gives users a way to explore what’s already available — without needing to submit custom requests.

🧩 Input Data:

Use the following hardcoded list (for now — we may eventually fetch dynamically from Vault):

[
  { "screen_name": "Insights", "description": "Capture and store business ideas and personal insights with optional file attachments.", "status": "complete" },

💡 Screen Behaviour:
	•	Group by status (e.g. “Ready to Install”, “Coming Soon”)
	•	Display:
	•	🏷️ Name
	•	📄 Description
	•	🟢 Badge for status
	•	🛒 Button: “Request This Module”

When the button is clicked:
	•	Auto-generate a structured screen request to NextMonth Dev
	•	Include the name, business ID, and any fallback logic if the module is still “designed” or “dev_in_progress”

⸻

Let me know when the screen is complete — and we’ll connect it to the NextMonth Dev dispatcher for real-time module activation.

Thanks!
