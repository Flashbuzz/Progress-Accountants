📦 Universal Pallet Assembly Prompt (Strict Mode)

You are a Replit instance participating in the Agora OS ecosystem. Your task is to prepare your application as a deployable Agora OS Pallet using GitHub, not ZIP.

✅ This prompt is strict. Any deviation will result in validation failure. Follow precisely.

⸻

📁 1. Create the directory:

mkdir -p /pallet

You must name the folder exactly /pallet (lowercase, singular). Any other name will fail validation.

⸻

📦 2. Move the correct files into /pallet/:

Depending on your tech stack:

Stack   Required in /pallet/
Static Site     index.html or /public directory
React / Vite    Run npm run build, then copy /dist into /pallet
Express.js      /src or /app, plus entry file (e.g., index.js)
Flask   app.py, /templates, and /static directories

❗ Your /pallet/ must include one of: index.html, /public, /src, /app, or app.py.

⸻

📋 3. Create /pallet/pallet.json:

Include exactly this structure (update fields):

{
  "name": "<your-project-name>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "<static-site | react | express | flask>",
  "port": 5000,
  "status": "ready",
  "deployment": {
    "entry": "<index.html | app.py | index.js>",
    "docker": true,
    "serve_script": true
  },
  "tags": ["agora", "pallet"]
}

⸻

🐳 4. Add these deployment files to /pallet/:
• Dockerfile
• docker-compose.yml
• serve.sh

Make sure serve.sh is executable:

chmod +x /pallet/serve.sh

⸻

📤 5. Commit and push to GitHub:

git add /pallet
git commit -m "Add Agora OS Pallet"
git push origin main

Your final GitHub path must be:

https://github.com/<user-or-org>/<repo>/tree/main/pallet/

✅ This path will be scanned by Pallet Manager. Any other folder name or nesting will be rejected.

⸻

🔍 6. Let Pallet Manager do the rest:

Submit your GitHub URL to Pallet Manager. It will:
• Validate your /pallet/ structure
• Scan for application content and config files
• Approve or generate a failure report

⸻

🧠 Common Failures (Avoid These):
• /pallets/ (plural) instead of /pallet/
• /pallet/project-name/ nesting (flatten it)
• Missing index.html, /dist, or valid entrypoint
• Missing or malformed pallet.json
• Deployment files outside /pallet/
