✨ Stage 2 Prompt: Build the Instant Help Assistant (Smart Contextual AI)

⸻

🎯 Stage 2 Focus

You will now:
	•	Build the first functional version of the Instant Help Assistant
	•	It will embed inside NextMonth and Agora OS dashboards
	•	It will analyze context automatically and offer smart suggestions before the user even asks for help
	•	If needed, escalate quietly into the Ticket Engine without fuss

⸻

🛠️ Tasks for Stage 2

⸻

1. Instant Help Widget (Frontend)

Element	Details
Position	Embedded directly into the interface — not floating bottom-right bubble (unless very minimal)
Activation	Small “Help” icon or button (always visible but subtle)
Opening Action	Opens clean support panel sliding from right side



⸻

2. Assistant Modes

2.1 Smart Passive Mode (Default)
	•	Without user clicking anything, the Assistant can:
	•	Detect current page or current tool being used
	•	Display a subtle “Need help with [Tool/Page Name]?” link above or inside the panel

Example:

You’re editing a Blueprint.
[Need help publishing your first Blueprint?]

(Tiny, classy suggestion — not pushy.)

⸻

2.2 Active Help Mode (On User Click)

When user opens the Assistant:

Title:
Instant Help Center

Subline:
Find quick tips, tutorials, or get guided help — instantly.

⸻

Options Available:

Option	Action
Quick Tips	List 2–4 context-specific quick actions
Search Help	Free text — “How can we help you?”
Report Issue	If user frustrated or stuck → escalates to Ticket Engine
Contact Support (optional)	ONLY appears if Ticket System deems escalation necessary



⸻

2.3 Example Quick Tip Based on Context

Context	Quick Tips
Media Upload Page	“Upload Your First Video” • “File Size Requirements”
Blueprint Builder	“Publishing Your Blueprint” • “Saving as Draft”
Account Settings	“Resetting Your Password” • “Setting Up SSO”



⸻

3. AI Smart Search (Optional for Premium)

Allow user to type in a free text query.
	•	If matches a FAQ or known help topic → auto-suggests the best article.
	•	Otherwise → escalate into Ticket Engine without friction.

⸻

4. Seamless Escalation

If:
	•	User signals frustration (“this didn’t help” click)
	•	User searches without finding help
	•	System detects repeated page reloads/errors

→ Redirect instantly but quietly to /support/ticket

Pre-fill any known info (user ID, current page, browser).

⸻

📜 Visual UX Notes

Element	Style
Assistant Panel	Slide-over, semi-transparent background
Typography	Calm, readable, professional tone
Animations	Soft fades, no clunky popups
Icons	Minimal, line-style icons (e.g., help, search, settings)



⸻

✅ Completion Confirmation

When Stage 2 is complete, output:

{
  "status": "Support System Stage 2 Completed",
  "instant_help_assistant_functional": "true",
  "smart_context_suggestions_working": "true",
  "smooth_escalation_to_ticket_engine_operational": "true"
}

Await Stage 3 instructions before proceeding.

⸻

🧠 Ratplet Reminders
	•	Context awareness is EVERYTHING. Always offer help based on current screen.
	•	No annoying popups or pushy chatbots — just intelligent, cinematic availability.
	•	Escalate gracefully when needed, without user ever feeling lost or abandoned.
