📦 TASK: ADMIN PANEL UI RESTRUCTURE

SmartSite is no longer a page builder. It is now an intelligence layer that upgrades existing websites with automated insights, lead intelligence, content creation, and AI assistant control.

Your task is to refactor the Admin Panel UI into 3 clearly separated zones:

---

### 🧠 NEW LAYOUT STRUCTURE:

1. **🗨️ Conversations & Customers**
   - Route Group: `/admin/conversations`
   - Modules:
     • `/admin/conversation-insights` – Chat transcripts, filters, tagging  
     • `/admin/crm` – Lead tracking and contact history  
     • `/admin/leads/lead-radar` – Lead scoring and visit-based triggers  
     • `/admin/autopilot` – Assistant override, blog automation, notifications

---

2. **✍️ Insights & Content**
   - Route Group: `/admin/insights`
   - Modules:
     • `/admin/insights-dashboard` – User behavior, page engagement  
     • `/admin/insight-users` – Who’s interacting and how  
     • `📘 Blog Generator` → Rename to `/admin/content/blog-posts`  
     • `📣 Social Generator` → Rename to `/admin/content/social-posts`  
     • `/admin/scope-request` – Optional feature request capture  

---

3. **🌐 Market View (Upgrade Required)**
   - Route Group: `/admin/market-intelligence`
   - Modules:
     • `/admin/market-trends` – Pulls live industry data, keyword shifts  
     • `/admin/competitor-watch` – AI-inferred competitor moves  
     • `/admin/trend-prompts` – Suggested post/campaign ideas  
     • Upgrade logic: If not subscribed, show teaser and upgrade CTA

---

✅ IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

• Update Admin sidebar navigation to reflect these 3 headings  
• Use section dividers and icons to clearly separate each panel  
• Ensure all renamed or moved components still load correctly  
• Add breadcrumbs or route indicators where useful  
• Optional: Add a dashboard summary screen that links into all 3 panels  

🧠 CONSIDERATIONS:

• All renamed routes must maintain backwards compatibility or redirect  
• Blog Generator and Social Generator should store content in the same backend system they already use — do not reset data  
• Teal accent color (#06B6D4) should be used consistently for section titles  

---

📣 OUTPUT:

1. Updated navigation structure
2. Route map of old paths → new paths
3. Confirmation that each new panel renders correctly
4. Teaser UI or logic placeholder for locked upgrade sections

Let’s finish the transformation. SmartSite is now *the brain* behind any website.
