ðŸ“¦ Replit Prompt: Prepare an Expandable, Hetzner-Ready Agora OS Pallet

You are a Replit instance participating in the Agora OS ecosystem.
Your task is to prepare your app as a Hetzner-ready, expandable Pallet for deployment, verification, and future growth.

â¸»

ðŸ§± 1. Scaffold the /pallet/ folder:

Create a /pallet/ directory that includes:
â€¢ Your existing app structure (e.g. /index.html, /public, /dist, etc.)
â€¢ Core config files for deployment
â€¢ Expandable placeholder folders for advanced features:
  â€¢ /whispers/ â†’ For system nudges + intelligent feedback
  â€¢ /blueprint/ â†’ For internal config, structure, SOT import/export
  â€¢ /council/ â†’ For AI council integrations or runtime logic
  â€¢ /api/ â†’ Placeholder for future routes or automation

Even if these are empty now, their presence signals that this app is designed to grow intelligently within Agora OS.

ðŸ“‹ 2. Include pallet.json

Create /pallet/pallet.json with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "<your-project-name>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "static-site",
  "port": 5000,
  "status": "ready",
  "deployment": {
    "entry": "index.html",
    "docker": true,
    "serve_script": true
  },
  "tags": ["agora", "pallet", "hetzner-ready", "scaffolded"],
  "expansion_ready": true
}
```

â¸»

ðŸ§  3. Add the deployment files:

Inside /pallet/, include:
â€¢ Dockerfile â†’ Build instructions for Hetzner
â€¢ docker-compose.yml â†’ Port + service config (default 5000)
â€¢ serve.sh â†’ Script to launch locally inside the container

â¸»

ðŸ“¤ 4. Push the app to GitHub

Push your /pallet/ folder to a public repo:

https://github.com/<your-org-or-user>/<your-project>/tree/main/pallet/

â¸»

ðŸ¤– 5. Let Pallet Manager Handle the Rest

Once you've pushed:
â€¢ Submit the link to Pallet Manager via "ðŸ”— Add GitHub Pallet"
â€¢ It will:
  â€¢ Validate the scaffold
  â€¢ Store your Pallet metadata
  â€¢ Prepare it for immediate or deferred Hetzner deployment

You don't have to use every part of the scaffold immediately, but it means you won't need to rewrap or rewire when your app evolves.
