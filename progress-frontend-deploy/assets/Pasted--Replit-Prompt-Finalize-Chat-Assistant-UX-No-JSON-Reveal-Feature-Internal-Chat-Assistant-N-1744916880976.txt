🟢 Replit Prompt: Finalize Chat Assistant UX (No JSON Reveal)

Feature: Internal Chat Assistant – “New Feature Request”
Update: Replace JSON output with polished confirmation animation and messaging

⸻

🎯 Objective

Update the current “New Feature Request” chat interface so that:
	•	The user never sees raw JSON output
	•	The experience feels smooth, supportive, and magical
	•	A clear sending animation is shown
	•	A clean success message is shown after the request is POSTed to NextMonth Dev

⸻

🧠 Behavior Breakdown

✅ 1. User confirms request

(e.g., says “Yes please” or clicks a confirm button after chat assistant asks)

→ Do not show the structured JSON

⸻

🔁 2. Show “Sending” animation

Replace the chat interface with a visual animation or loading state:
	•	Example: Bouncing dots, flying paper plane, spinning icon
	•	Accompanying message:

“Sending your request to NextMonth Dev…”

⸻

✅ 3. Show confirmation on success

Once the POST to https://nextmonth-dev.replit.app/listen succeeds:

Display this message (Option A):

✅ “Your request has been received by the Dev team. They’ll begin work on your new screen shortly.”

Or (Option B, playful):

🎉 “All done! I’ve handed your idea to the Dev team. They’re already sharpening their tools…”

Then show:
	•	Button: Start Another Request
	•	Optional: View Past Requests (if logging requests later)

⸻

❌ 4. Error handling (fallback)

If the request fails:

❌ “Something went wrong while sending your request. Please try again or reach out for support.”

	•	Retry button

⸻

🛠 POST Logic (unchanged)

fetch("https://nextmonth-dev.replit.app/listen", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(promptPayload)
})

💅 Design Notes
	•	Keep the “assistant” tone warm, calm, and competent
	•	Match button styling to rest of admin UI
	•	Keep animations lightweight and quick (~2–4 seconds total)

⸻

Once done, this will feel like magic:
	•	You talk to the system
	•	It understands
	•	It quietly sends the build request
	•	And confirms your studio is on it.
