üöÄ NEW FEATURE: SmartSite Autopilot + Manual Override Controls

You are now adding a new admin screen to the SmartSite Control Room:

üß≠ Route: /admin/autopilot  
üß† Component: AutopilotControlPanel.tsx  
üîí Access: Admin, Super Admin only

---

üß© REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY:

‚úÖ 1. BLOG AUTOPILOT SETTINGS
Add a section that allows the user to toggle on/off blog auto-posting.

Fields:
- [ ] Enable Blog Autopilot [Toggle]
- [ ] Posting Frequency: [Dropdown: Daily, Weekly, Fortnightly, Monthly]
- [ ] Content Source: [Multi-select: Chat questions, Lead insights, Market trends (if unlocked)]
- [ ] AI Tone Preference: [Dropdown: Friendly, Professional, Authoritative, Casual]
- [ ] Review Before Publish? [Toggle: If enabled, send draft to Admin Panel for approval]

Store this in the user's config settings and use it to schedule post-generation via CRON or background task.

‚úÖ 2. CHAT OVERRIDE NOTIFICATIONS

Add a section that allows the user to define when they want to be alerted and jump in:

Fields:
- [ ] Notify me by email when a user is chatting live [Toggle]
- [ ] Notify me only if lead score > 70 [Toggle]

These will integrate with the SmartSite assistant runtime and notification system.

‚úÖ 3. UI/UX DESIGN NOTES

- This page should match the teal-accented Admin Control Room styling.
- Use logical sections with h2 headings: "Blog Autopilot" / "Chat Notifications".
- Use switches, dropdowns, and toggles ‚Äî keep it minimal but smart.

---

üõ†Ô∏è FILE STRUCTURE TO CREATE:

- `src/routes/admin/autopilot.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/AutopilotControlPanel.tsx`
- `src/services/autopilotService.ts` (for storing/retrieving settings)
- Extend existing user settings or config schema to support autopilot fields.

---

üì£ OUTPUT:

Once complete, return:
1. Screenshot or summary of UI structure
2. Confirmation that blog autopilot and chat triggers are storing correctly
3. Location of logic hook (or placeholder) that external systems can call to:
   - Trigger blog generation
   - Send email alerts for assistant takeover

Let‚Äôs make SmartSite work *for* the user ‚Äî and let them decide when to step in.
