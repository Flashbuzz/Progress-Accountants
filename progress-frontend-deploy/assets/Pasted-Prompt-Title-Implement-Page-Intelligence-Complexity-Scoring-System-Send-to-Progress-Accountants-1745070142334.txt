Prompt Title: Implement Page Intelligence + Complexity Scoring System

Send to: Progress Accountants Replit Instance

Goal: Introduce structured page classification (internal/external), add module activation awareness, and triage bespoke page requests based on AI scoring.

‚úÖ Core Enhancements

1. Page Classification
	‚Ä¢	For each route in the system, add a page_metadata object:

{
  path: "/services",
  title: "Services",
  access: "internal" | "external",
  seo: {
    title: "Accounting Services | Progress Accountants",
    description: "Explore our tax, bookkeeping, and advisory services.",
    canonical: "/services"
  },
  page_type: "core" | "custom" | "automation"
}

	‚Ä¢	Use this metadata to:
	‚Ä¢	Guide Guardian SEO audits
	‚Ä¢	Enforce access control (withAuth)
	‚Ä¢	Control visibility in navigation

2. Module Activation Logging
	‚Ä¢	When a new page/module is activated:
	‚Ä¢	Save a log in the database with:
	‚Ä¢	user_id, module_id, activated_at, page_metadata
	‚Ä¢	Optionally POST summary to Guardian: /client-check-in with activated_modules array
	‚Ä¢	Add user-facing ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New‚Äù feed from this data

3. Page Complexity Triage
	‚Ä¢	When a user requests a bespoke page:
	‚Ä¢	Use OpenAI to analyze:
	‚Ä¢	Estimated visual complexity (sections, interactivity)
	‚Ä¢	Required logic (forms, automation, data feeds)
	‚Ä¢	Estimated effort (simple | moderate | complex | wishlist)
	‚Ä¢	Save this triage result to:
	‚Ä¢	Vault (as metadata on the scope request)
	‚Ä¢	Guardian (as advisory signal for human escalation)
	‚Ä¢	Display triage result and fallback options to user

‚∏ª

üîó Vault & Guardian Integration
	‚Ä¢	Vault: Save page_metadata and complexity_score via /api/blueprint/pages
	‚Ä¢	Guardian:
	‚Ä¢	POST /client-check-in for every module activation
	‚Ä¢	POST /scope-request-assessments with triage result
	‚Ä¢	If complexity = wishlist, notify Dev to review

‚∏ª

üì§ Expected Outputs
	‚Ä¢	page_metadata.ts created or extended
	‚Ä¢	Module activation logging persisted and optionally posted to Guardian
	‚Ä¢	ScopeRequest flow upgraded to include AI-based complexity scoring
	‚Ä¢	Vault/Guardian aware of all page types, activations, and triage events
