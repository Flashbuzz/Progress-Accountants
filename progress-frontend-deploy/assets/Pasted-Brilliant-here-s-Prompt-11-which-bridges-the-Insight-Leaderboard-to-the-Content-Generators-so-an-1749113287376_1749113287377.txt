🧭 AFFECTED ROUTE:  
- `/admin/insights-dashboard`  
📁 Component: `InsightLeaderboard.tsx`

---

🧩 FEATURE ADDITION:

For each row or card in the leaderboard, add two buttons:

1. **“✍️ Write a Post”**  
   - Action: Open `/admin/content/blog-posts` with the insight preloaded as the prompt
   - Prefill blog generator:
     - Suggested title based on the insight
     - Full insight text in body editor
     - Option to edit tone (default to “Informative”)

2. **“📣 Create Social Snippet”**  
   - Action: Open `/admin/content/social-posts` with insight as the caption prompt
   - Prefill social generator:
     - Suggested post for LinkedIn or X
     - Add related hashtag if available from topic category

Use router state or query params to pass the selected insight content to the respective generator pages.

🛠️ TECH SPECS:

- Use `useNavigate` or router push with embedded payload or `?prompt=` param
- Make sure `BlogPostGenerator.tsx` and `SocialPostGenerator.tsx` check for preloaded insight content
- Use markdown or basic HTML parsing to preserve formatting where needed

Example param:
```ts
navigate('/admin/content/blog-posts?prompt=Great customer story from Tuesday’s delivery feedback...')

🎨 UI/UX NOTES:
	•	Buttons appear as small inline actions under or beside each insight
	•	Use light gray buttons with teal icon/text hover
	•	Tooltip: “Turn this insight into a new blog post” / “Convert to social post”

⸻

📣 OUTPUT:
	1.	Buttons live and working in Insight Leaderboard
	2.	Blog + Social generators accept and prefill the content
	3.	Confirmed insight context carries through properly
	4.	Optional: Toast or banner when content generator opens prefilled

Let’s help businesses turn raw intelligence into visible action — instantly.
