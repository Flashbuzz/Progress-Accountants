üõ†Ô∏è Tasks for Stage 7

‚∏ª

1. Full System Component Checklist

Component	Ready Check
Instant Help Assistant	Functional across all screens, smart context awareness, escalation to Ticket Engine works
Self-Resolving Ticket Engine	Accepts structured user input, offers instant suggestions, escalates if needed
Admin Support Panel	Lists tickets, allows status changes, admin notes, ticket exports
Proactive Health Monitoring	Background checks operational, preemptive messaging functional
Personalized Support Digest Generator	Summarizes resolved support interactions, user notifications working

‚úÖ Confirm each is functional.

‚∏ª

2. User Journey Simulation Tests

Run these realistic scenarios:

Scenario	Expected Behavior
Minor Upload Problem	Assistant offers instant tip; user resolves it without needing ticket
Calendar Booking Glitch	User submits ticket; Ticket Engine suggests fix; user solves it
Critical Error Spike	Health Monitor preemptively notifies users + flags Admin
Full Ticket Escalation	User stuck, ticket escalates to Admin Panel properly
Support Digest	User receives cinematic digest confirming resolution

Confirm that users feel helped, not lost, at every point.

	‚Ä¢	Animations are subtle (no jarring popups)
	‚Ä¢	Support feels like part of the platform (not a bolted-on helpdesk)

‚∏ª

5. Final Certification Report

When all checks are passed, output:

{
  "status": "Support System Certification Completed",
  "deployment_ready": "true",
  "components_verified": [
    "instant_help_assistant",
    "self_resolving_ticket_engine",
    "admin_support_panel",
    "proactive_health_monitoring",
    "personalized_support_digest"
  ],
  "user_experience_verified": "true",

üìú Visual UX Notes for Final Check
	‚Ä¢	ALL touchpoints must feel smooth, polished, premium.
	‚Ä¢	Users should never see raw error messages or dead-ends.
	‚Ä¢	Admin view must stay simple even as ticket volumes grow.

‚∏ª

üß† Ratplet Reminders
	‚Ä¢	Remember: This system must scale from 1 user to 10,000+ users with no loss of quality.
	‚Ä¢	Always prioritize graceful degradation ‚Äî even if something goes wrong, make it cinematic.
	‚Ä¢	Keep all future expansions modular: more health checks, more Digest options, more assistant smartness.
