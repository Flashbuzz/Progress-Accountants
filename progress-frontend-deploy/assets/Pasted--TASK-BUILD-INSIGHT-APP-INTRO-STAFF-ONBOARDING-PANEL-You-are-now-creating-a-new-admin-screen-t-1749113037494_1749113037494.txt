🧠 TASK: BUILD INSIGHT APP INTRO & STAFF ONBOARDING PANEL

You are now creating a new admin screen that:

1. Introduces the Insight App (a lightweight tool for team members to submit observations, stories, or issues).
2. Allows Admins to assign users to receive the app via email.
3. Ensures submitted insights route directly into the SmartSite Insight Leaderboard.

🧩 PANEL STRUCTURE

### 📣 Section 1: What is the Insight App?

Use content blocks or expandable text to explain the concept:

> "The Insight App gives every member of your team a way to share important stories, ideas, and feedback — in 30 seconds or less."

- Good news stories and testimonials
- Employee frustrations or wins
- Customer complaints or praise
- Suggestions for improvement
- Employee satisfaction cues
- Lead triggers from casual convos
- Pain points before they escalate

✨ All insights feed directly into your leaderboard — no login needed.

### 👥 Section 2: Add a Team Member

Simple form:

- [ ] First Name  
- [ ] Last Name  
- [ ] Email Address  
- Button: `Send Insight App Invite`

📧 This triggers an email with:
- Subject: “You’ve been invited to use the Insight App”  
- Body:
  > “[Your Company] has given you access to the Insight App — a lightweight tool for quickly sharing ideas, stories, or feedback. Just click the link and start typing — no login required.”

- Link structure: `https://insight.smartsitehub.io/submit?user=XYZ_TOKEN`

Tokens are one-time created and tied to email/user.

### 📈 Section 3: Submitted Insights

Show a mini-table of:
- Name / Email
- Number of insights submitted
- Last submission date
- Button: `View Leaderboard` (links to `/admin/insights-dashboard`)

---

🎨 UI NOTES:

- Use card layout
- Include info icon popovers on “Why collect insights?”
- Add subtle teal success messages on invite sent

📁 FILES TO CREATE:

- `src/routes/admin/insight-app.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/InsightAppOnboarding.tsx`
- `src/services/insightUserService.ts` – create, store, validate tokens

📣 OUTPUT:

2. Confirmation that email/token system is active
3. Insights from staff show up in leaderboard
4. Table of assigned users and submission activity

Let’s make every staff member a sensor — and make sure every moment worth capturing *is*.
