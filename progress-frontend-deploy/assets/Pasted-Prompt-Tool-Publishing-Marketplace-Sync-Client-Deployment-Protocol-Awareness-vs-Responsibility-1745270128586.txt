Prompt: Tool Publishing, Marketplace Sync & Client Deployment Protocol
(Awareness vs. Responsibility Clarification Included)

Please implement the following universal protocol for the publishing, syncing, and deployment of tools across the NextMonth ecosystem.

Note: All Replit instances (Lab, Dev, Client) must be aware of this full workflow for visibility and continuity, but each instance is only expected to action its own responsibilities.

⸻

1. Tool Publishing from Lab

Lab Instance Responsibilities Only
	•	When a tool is finalized, Lab must:
	•	Assign:
	•	tool_name
	•	tool_version (semantic format: e.g., v1.0.0)
	•	tool_category (e.g., CRM, Analytics, SEO)
	•	Package the tool with schema, endpoints, and configuration
	•	Push the tool to NextMonth Dev marked as draft_for_marketplace
	•	Notify Dev and Guardian of intent to publish

⸻

2. Syncing to the Marketplace via Dev

Dev Instance Responsibilities Only
	•	When Dev receives a tool from Lab:
	•	Review and approve the tool metadata
	•	Publish the tool to the Tools Marketplace
	•	Change status to published_in_marketplace
	•	Confirm publishing success back to Lab and Guardian
	•	Notify all active client instances of the new tool availability

⸻

3. Tool Installation by Clients

Client Instances (e.g., Progress) Responsibilities Only
	•	Clients may browse tools via /api/tools/marketplace
	•	Upon installing a tool:
	•	Register it under installed_tools with tenant_id
	•	Respect tool_version and tool configuration
	•	Use the tool’s local options to customize for the tenant
	•	Optionally notify Dev of any feedback or incompatibilities

⸻

4. System-Wide Logging and Vault Sync

Responsibilities:
	•	All instances must log their own actions with:
	•	actor, timestamp, tool_name, tool_version, and action
	•	Dev is responsible for syncing all published tools to Vault (WordPress)
	•	Guardian tracks all stages and alerts on any errors, mismatches, or deployment gaps

⸻

5. Tool Categories & Discovery

Lab sets, Dev validates
	•	All tools must have a tool_category for sorting in the Marketplace
	•	Dev ensures categories are valid and consistent across Marketplace
