	‚Ä¢	Allow Admin users (Rob initially) to:
	‚Ä¢	View support submissions
	‚Ä¢	Update ticket statuses
	‚Ä¢	Add internal notes
	‚Ä¢	Export ticket records

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Tasks for Stage 4

‚∏ª

1. Create Admin Panel Route

Route	Purpose
/admin/support-requests	Central Admin Panel for managing user support tickets



‚∏ª

2. Admin Panel Layout

2.1 Submission List View (Main Screen)

Column	Content
Name	User full name
Issue Summary	Short description of the problem
Area Affected	System area (auto-pulled from structured ticket)
Submission Date	Date/time of ticket
Status	New / In Progress / Resolved / Escalated
Actions	[View Full Ticket] button



‚∏ª

Features:
	‚Ä¢	Sortable by date, name, system area
	‚Ä¢	Filterable by Status (e.g., New, In Progress)
	‚Ä¢	Basic search function (search by user name, issue summary)

‚∏ª

2.2 Full Ticket View (When Admin Clicks [View Full Ticket])

Displays:

Section	Content
User Information	Name, Email (if available), User ID (if session linked)
Ticket Details	All structured data: action tried, system page, device type, etc.
Auto-Suggested Resolution	(If any was shown during Ticket creation)
Admin Notes Field	Editable field for internal updates
Status Update Dropdown	New / In Progress / Resolved / Escalated

‚∏ª

3. Ticket Status Management

Status	Meaning
New	Fresh submission, unreviewed
In Progress	Under investigation or awaiting user reply
Resolved	Issue solved and closed
Escalated	Complex case, potentially needing Rob‚Äôs direct intervention

Statuses must update without full page reload (prefer AJAX/live updating).

‚∏ª

4. Admin Notes Field

Allow internal-only admin notes to be stored with the ticket.

Examples:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCalled client 12/05, advised clear cache.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúProblem was browser plugin conflict.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúAsked user to retry file upload on Chrome.‚Äù

‚∏ª

5. Export Ticket Record

Allow downloading each ticket individually:
	‚Ä¢	Format: JSON or CSV
	‚Ä¢	Includes full user answers, system context, admin notes, timestamps

‚∏ª

üìú Visual UX Notes

Element	Style
List View	Premium clean table (borderless rows, alternating backgrounds)
Ticket Details View	Card-style sections for info separation
Notes Field	Subtle editable box (autosaves if possible)
Loading/Updates	Micro-interactions only (smooth transitions)



‚∏ª

‚úÖ Completion Confirmation

Await Stage 5 instructions before proceeding.

‚∏ª

üß† Ratplet Reminders
	‚Ä¢	Keep Admin Panel lightweight and scalable ‚Äî it should easily handle 10 ‚Üí 1,000+ tickets.
	‚Ä¢	Prioritize fast ticket access, minimal clicks to get full issue context.
	‚Ä¢	Always display Admin Notes and Ticket Status cleanly and separately.
