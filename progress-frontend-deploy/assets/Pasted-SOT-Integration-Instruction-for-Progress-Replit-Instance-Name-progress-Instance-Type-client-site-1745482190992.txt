SOT Integration Instruction for Progress Replit
Instance Name: progress
Instance Type: client_site
SOT Blueprint Version: v1.1.2
Issued On: 2025-04-24T20:04Z
________________________________________
Context Summary
You are receiving this prompt because the Progress client site is now being transitioned into a fully SOT-compliant ecosystem member within the NextMonth platform.
The previous coordination layer, Guardian, is now deprecated.
From this point forward, all critical logic, tool awareness, and system-wide instructions will flow through the SOT (Single Source of Truth), available at:
https://source-of-truth.replit.app
This change is part of a strategic upgrade to unify all business sites, tools, automations, and analytics under a consistent, versioned coordination model.
________________________________________
Why This Matters to You
As a client site, the Progress instance will:
•	Receive tool updates from the SOT
•	Be notified when shared packages change (e.g. content tools, automation templates)
•	Report back to the SOT on installed tools, page configurations, and sync status
•	Gain access to a dedicated website dashboard, showing:
o	Site-wide analytics (page count, tool usage, etc.)
o	Top industry news (via dynamic feeds)
o	Tool update notices and statuses
o	Deployment history and sync status

Your Responsibilities
You do not need to author or manage system-wide protocols. Instead, your instance must:
1.	Declare itself to the SOT
o	Endpoint: POST /api/sot/declaration
o	Payload example:
o	{
o	  "instance_id": "progress",
o	  "instance_type": "client_site",
o	  "blueprint_version": "1.1.2",
o	  "tools_supported": ["page_builder", "tool_launcher", "dashboard_analytics"],
o	  "callback_url": "https://progress.replit.app/api/sot/callback",
o	  "status": "active"
o	}
2.	Listen for protocol updates
o	Implement /api/sot/callback to receive schema/tool updates from SOT
3.	Sync basic metrics
o	Total pages
o	Installed tools
o	Last sync timestamp
o	This helps SOT maintain ecosystem-wide visibility
4.	Remove all Guardian references
o	Guardian should no longer be referenced in any routes, dashboards, or admin logic.

Optional Enhancements
If your dashboard supports it, consider:
•	A “SOT Status” panel to show:
o	Sync freshness
o	Last update received
o	Blueprint compatibility check
•	A “Refresh from SOT” button in the admin

Next Steps
Please confirm the following actions are complete:
•	Your SOT declaration has been sent
•	Guardian has been removed
•	Your callback endpoint is listening
•	Your dashboard reflects the SOT sync status
When ready, reply with:
"Progress is SOT-ready. Awaiting verification."
And I’ll generate a final confirmation payload to lock you in.
