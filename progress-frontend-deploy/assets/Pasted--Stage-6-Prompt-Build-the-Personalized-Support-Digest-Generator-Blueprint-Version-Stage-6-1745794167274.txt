✨ Stage 6 Prompt: Build the Personalized Support Digest Generator (Blueprint Version)

⸻

🎯 Stage 6 Focus

You will now:
	•	Build the Personalized Support Digest Generator
	•	After major support interactions (resolved ticket, self-resolved issue, escalated help session),
the system automatically sends a clean, cinematic Digest to the user
	•	It must work generically across all NextMonth Blueprint client sites (Progress, Beta Sites, etc.)

⸻

📜 Visual UX Notes

Element	Style
Support Digest	Minimalist, premium card layout (think “mission debrief” style)
Typography	Calm, high-end sans-serif font
Animations	Subtle fade-in of Digest page/notification



⸻

✅ Completion Confirmation

When Stage 6 is complete, output:

{
  "status": "Support System Stage 6 Completed",
  "support_digest_generation_operational": "true",
  "user_notification_delivery_operational": "true",
  "support_history_recording_operational": "true"
}

Await Stage 7 instructions before proceeding.

⸻

🧠 Ratplet Reminders
	•	Digests must feel cinematic and valuable — not transactional or spammy.
	•	Always phrase Digests as “mission completions” not just “ticket closed.”
	•	Store Digests for reference if needed later (build trust over time).
