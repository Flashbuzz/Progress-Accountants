✅ Replit Prompt — Frontend Extraction & Cleanup for Progress Accountants

🧠 SYSTEM INSTRUCTION

You are now preparing the Progress Accountants project for a clean, standalone frontend deployment. The goal is to deploy a demo version of the **Progress public-facing site only** — no backend or admin logic included.

---

✅ STEP 1: WHAT TO EXTRACT

• Extract the entire `client/` directory as the new root of the project.
• Copy `shared/schema.ts` **only if necessary** for typed components — otherwise remove unused references.
• Include these config files:
  - `vite.config.ts`
  - `tailwind.config.ts`
  - `postcss.config.js`
  - `index.html` if used

---

✅ STEP 2: WHAT TO REMOVE / LEAVE BEHIND

• Do NOT include:
  - `server/` directory (entire backend)
  - `drizzle.config.ts` or any backend DB config
  - Server-specific dependencies in `package.json` (clean this list!)
  - Old server scripts in `package.json` (keep only frontend build + preview commands)

---

✅ STEP 3: API CONFIGURATION

• Set up `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` to point to the existing backend (if public API needed), or a **demo mock URL**.
• Update all API calls to use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` as base.
• If any API endpoints require authentication → fallback to **anonymous mode** or mock content for demo.

---

✅ STEP 4: AUTH HANDLING

• If frontend includes `auth hooks`:
  - Make sure they handle “not authenticated” state gracefully.
  - Do not redirect to backend auth pages in this public demo build.
  - Optionally show “Login disabled in demo mode” if needed.

---

✅ STEP 5: DEMO LABELING (for today’s demo)

• In navbar and footer, append:  
  → “Progress Accountants | Demo Site”  
• Remove links to admin areas or backend routes.

---

✅ STEP 6: BUILD CONFIG

• Prepare the project to deploy as:
  - A **Vite static build** (preferred: Hetzner-ready or Netlify-ready)
• Confirm `vite.config.ts` paths do not alias to `/server` or backend.
• Confirm build runs cleanly with:
  ```bash
  npm run build
