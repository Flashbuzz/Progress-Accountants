### **How the Client Sites Will Be Connected**

- **Each client site (clone) is its own independent instance.**  
  - Separate database (or database namespace).
  - Separate user accounts.
  - Separate public pages.

- **NextMonthDev acts as a Central Authority / Satellite Hub**, but **not a content host**.
  - It stores system-wide tooling (the Marketplace).
  - It stores system blueprints and upgrades.
  - It monitors health and upgrades via Mission Control.
  - It **does not** store actual client user content or business data directly.
  - It might broker inter-client communication when needed.

- **Inter-client communication (e.g., Networking Pages)** must happen via a **shared service layer**:
  - Example: A secure **NextMonth Hub API** that both client sites can query.
  - Each client site pushes *only* intended networking data (e.g., public profiles, public posts) into the shared hub.
  - Sites query the hub for other users’ public info.

**Diagrammatically:**

```
Client Site A →    |
                   | → NextMonth Hub API → Combined Networking Data
Client Site B →    |
                   |
Progress →         |
```

- **Messages** would also route through the **NextMonth Hub**:
  - Users never communicate *directly* between databases.
  - Instead, they send a message → Hub → routed to the intended user's site inbox.

### **Networking Page Design Advice**

1. **Profile Structure:**
   - Each user has a **local profile** stored in their own site's DB.
   - **Public profile info** (name, headline, about, maybe business name) is synced to the Hub if networking is enabled.

2. **Posts/Content Feed:**
   - Local posts stay local unless user chooses to publish to the shared feed.
   - Feed page pulls cross-client posts via Hub API.

3. **Messaging Across Sites:**
   - Users can message anyone visible on the Hub feed.
   - Messages are routed through the Hub (stored briefly, delivered to recipient site inbox).
   - Notifications stay within each site instance.

4. **Security + Privacy Layer:**
   - Only data specifically authorized for networking leaves the local site.
   - All inter-site data must be **opt-in**.
   - Personal data not designated for networking **never leaves** the client site DB.

### **Summary**

- **NextMonthDev is the mothership** — holds blueprints, system health, tools.
- **Each site is an independent planet** — self-sufficient unless it *chooses* to connect.
- **NextMonth Hub API is the interstellar relay station** — allowing connection, networking, messaging safely and efficiently.
- **Networking pages pull from local AND shared sources** depending on user's privacy settings.
