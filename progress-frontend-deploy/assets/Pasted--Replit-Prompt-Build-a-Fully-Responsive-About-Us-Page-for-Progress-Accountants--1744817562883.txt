3. 🔧 How We Work
Content: Display as 3 cards or info blocks:
•	Technology that works for you.
Our client dashboards and automation tools are designed to give you real-time insight, eliminate bottlenecks, and keep everything flowing smoothly.

We don’t wait for deadlines to chase you—we flag what’s needed in advance, guide you through it, and get things done early.
•	People-first mindset.
We may be tech-led, but we’re human at heart. You’ll always have someone on your side, ready to explain, support, and go the extra mile.
Design Notes:
•	Use icons or subtle animations on hover
•	Cards should stack vertically on mobile
