🧱 TASK: CREATE MARKETPLACE PLACEHOLDER SCREEN

You are now creating a new route inside the SmartSite Admin Panel:

🧭 Route: `/admin/marketplace`  
📁 Component: `MarketplacePlaceholder.tsx`  
🔒 Access: Admin, Super Admin

---

🧩 OBJECTIVE:

This screen will eventually become the **gateway to the NextMonth Lab ecosystem**, allowing users to browse and activate advanced tools, services, and plugins. For now, it is a structured placeholder.

---

### 🧩 DESIGN STRUCTURE:

✅ Section 1: Intro

- Title: “Marketplace”
- Subtitle: “Enhance your SmartSite with advanced tools from NextMonth Lab”
- Description:
  > “From AI-powered schedulers to video transcription engines, the Marketplace will allow you to extend your site with cutting-edge tools — built by the NextMonth ecosystem.”

✅ Section 2: Coming Soon Cards (3–4)

Mock cards with placeholders like:
- 📹 “Video Snippet Generator” – Auto-create social clips from long-form video
- 📆 “AI Scheduler” – Let visitors book services via your assistant
- 🗂 “SmartSite CRM Pro” – Upgrade your lead handling
- 🧠 “Dev Council Add-on” – Embedded in-app bug feedback + improvement loop

Each card includes:
- Title
- Icon
- Short 1–2 sentence description
- Disabled “Add to SmartSite” button

✅ Section 3: Notify Me Form (Optional)

> “Want early access to new tools?”
- Email field + Submit button
- Saves to local DB or placeholder webhook

---

🎨 UI NOTES:

- Card grid layout (3-column on desktop, 1-column mobile)
- Use subtle gray tones for disabled features
- Highlight NextMonth Lab branding in intro

---

📁 FILES TO CREATE:

- `src/routes/admin/marketplace.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/MarketplacePlaceholder.tsx`
- Optional: `src/mock/marketplaceMockData.ts` to store placeholder tool data

---

📣 OUTPUT:

1. A styled placeholder UI with 3–4 mock tools
2. Confirmation that route is live and navigable
3. Stub webhook or console log on form submission (if Notify Me form is included)

Let’s give SmartSite a visible runway into the larger ecosystem — starting now.
