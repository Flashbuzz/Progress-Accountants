Page 2 Concept: The Smart Business Forecast Calculator
Working Title:
"Know Your Numbers. Predict Your Growth."
(Or alternatively: “The Smarter Way to Understand Your Business Finances”)

Objective:
Build the most advanced and user-personalised small business calculator in the industry. Not just a tax calculator or profit predictor—but an intelligent, context-aware business planner that:

Gives insightful outputs tailored to the user's business model, size, goals, and challenges

Helps users see where they are now, and what happens if they tweak cash flow, staffing, investment, or pricing

Feels like sitting with a modern accountant, not using a glorified spreadsheet

Acts as a high-quality lead magnet: users must enter their email to receive their full personalised report

Lead Gen Integration:
