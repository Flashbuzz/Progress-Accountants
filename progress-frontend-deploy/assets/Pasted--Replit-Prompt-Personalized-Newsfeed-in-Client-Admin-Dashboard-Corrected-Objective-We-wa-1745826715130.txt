✨ Replit Prompt: Personalized Newsfeed in Client Admin Dashboard (Corrected)

⸻

🎯 Objective

We want to enhance the admin dashboard experience for each client:
	•	Currently, the admin dashboard displays a default newsfeed (general updates).
	•	Moving forward, each client site should have its own bespoke, industry-specific newsfeed displayed inside the admin dashboard — not on the public homepage.
	•	When creating and deploying a Blueprint, we must be able to select which newsfeed source the client admin dashboard pulls from.

⸻

⚡ Key Requirements
	1.	Blueprint Flexibility:
During site creation (Blueprint stage), we should be able to:
	•	Select an industry category (e.g., Accounting News, Legal News, Construction News, etc.)
	•	OR manually enter a custom RSS or API feed if needed.
	2.	Deployment Logic:
When the Blueprint is deployed:
	•	The selected newsfeed source should automatically integrate into the client’s admin dashboard feed panel.
	•	No manual code editing after deployment should be necessary.
	3.	Client Admin Dashboard Behavior:
	•	Admin dashboard displays dynamic, real-time news pulled from the assigned feed.
	•	News items refresh periodically (e.g., every 30–60 mins).
	•	If feed is unavailable, display a premium fallback message like:
“Currently no new updates. Your feed will refresh automatically.”

⸻

🛠️ Key Questions (Sense Check)
	•	Is it technically feasible with our current Blueprint + Deploy system to parameterize the admin dashboard newsfeed source during deployment?
	•	Would you recommend:
	•	Setting the feed source via dynamic environment variables at build time?
	•	Including a config file per deployment that defines the client’s feed URL?
	•	Another method for lightweight, modular feed assignment?
	•	Is there a best practice you suggest for RSS/API pull + refreshing inside an admin dashboard view?

⸻

🧠 Ratplet Reminders
	•	Newsfeeds must stay modular and scalable (1 → 1,000+ client dashboards).
	•	No separate admin dashboard codebases per client — must all stay unified under Blueprint principles.
	•	Future-proof idea: support multi-feed widgets later (e.g., “Company News + Industry News”) if needed.
