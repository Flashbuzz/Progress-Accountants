Prompt 2: Build the Foundation Pages Overview Screen

Context for Replit:

Now that the user has completed their homepage setup, we want to guide them through a series of essential foundation pages (About, Services, Contact, etc.). These are optional but recommended.

Each page has:
	•	A clean visual card
	•	A “Start Setup” button
	•	A completion status indicator
	•	Option to skip—but only after actively choosing to skip

Once the user completes (or skips) all foundation pages, they’re taken to Launch Mode, where they can access the Marketplace and build freely.

Provide a visual, confidence-inspiring interface where the user can:

	•	Launch into the setup screen for each

State Management:

Each setup screen stores to:

project_context.pages.about = { ... }
project_context.pages.services = { ... }
project_context.pages.contact = { ... }
...

Track status per page:

project_context.page_status = {
  about: "complete",
  services: "in_progress",
  contact: "not_started",
  ...
}



⸻

Navigation Logic:
	•	Once all pages are marked complete or skipped, user is shown a “Continue to Launch” button at bottom of screen.
	•	Button is disabled until all pages have been acknowledged (completed or skipped).
	•	Upon clicking, route to: /launch-ready

⸻

Design Notes:
	•	Use cards with hover/focus effects for good UX
	•	Visually distinct “Start Setup” vs “Skip for Now” buttons
	•	Completion status visually reinforces progress
	•	Use progress bar or tracker if needed
