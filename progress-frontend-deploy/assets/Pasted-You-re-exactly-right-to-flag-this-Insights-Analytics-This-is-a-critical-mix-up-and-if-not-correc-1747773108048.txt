You’re exactly right to flag this—Insights ≠ Analytics. This is a critical mix-up, and if not corrected, you’re losing access to one of the most valuable features of the system: the feedback loop between end users, internal staff, and the business’s content strategy.

🧠 Insights vs Analytics (Clarification)

⚠️ What Happened?
	•	The /analytics route was correctly added to fix a routing error—but it appears that the “View Insights” button was accidentally routed there, possibly due to:
	•	A mislabelled navService.ts
	•	Or a misinterpretation of “insights” as traffic data

✅ What Needs to Be Done

Here’s the corrected Replit Prompt to restore proper functionality:

🛠️ Prompt for Replit: Fix Misdirected Insights Link

You’ve successfully routed /analytics to the AnalyticsPage component.

However, the “View Insights” menu item is currently pointing to /analytics—which is incorrect.

✅ The correct destination should be:
/insights-dashboard (or whatever route renders the InsightsDashboard component used to summarize:
	•	Frontend chat feedback
	•	Client queries
	•	Business content suggestions)

⸻

Required Fixes:
	1.	Routing
	•	Create or restore route:

<ProtectedRoute path="/insights-dashboard" component={InsightsDashboard} roles={['admin', 'super_admin', 'editor']} />


	2.	Navigation Correction
	•	In the nav config (likely navService.ts), change:

{
  label: "View Insights",
  path: "/analytics",
  ...
}

➤ To:

{
  label: "View Insights",
  path: "/insights-dashboard",
  ...
}


	3.	Fallback
	•	If /insights-dashboard is not implemented, restore or regenerate the Insights component used to:
	•	Display conversation summaries
	•	List insight tags from visitors
	•	Support blog idea generation
