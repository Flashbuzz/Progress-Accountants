Hey Replit 👋

Amazing work on the first iteration of the Progress Accountants homepage — it’s sharp, professional, and already communicates our value brilliantly.

Now that we’ve seen it live, we’re ready to take it to Phase 2, adding some strategic images and polish to bring it fully to life visually.

🧠 Key Focus This Round:
We want to strengthen:

Emotional connection (showing the real people behind Progress)

Visual reinforcement of our USPs (like the podcast studio + dashboard)

Professional but warm energy, avoiding anything too corporate or generic

✅ Please include these design upgrades and image slots:
🔥 Hero Section
Add image slot: hero_team_photo.jpg

Suggested: Horizontal team photo (smiling, relaxed, modern)

Use as right-aligned static image next to headline and subhead

🧰 Growth Tools Section (3 Cards)
For each card, add a real image to reinforce the feature:

🎙️ tools_podcast_studio.jpg
→ Someone using the podcast/video studio (mic, headphones, camera)

📊 tools_dashboard_mockup.jpg
→ UI of a custom dashboard (stylised if needed)

🧠 tools_strategy_session.jpg
→ Visual of a business strategy session, ideally human-centred

These images can appear above or beside the text inside each card.

🌍 Specialist Industries Section
Swap the emoji icons for custom images:

🎬 industry_film.jpg

🎵 industry_music.jpg

🏗️ industry_construction.jpg

Format: Clean 3-column layout, each with image + title + supporting text.

🤝 Testimonial / Dashboard Section
Add a real photo for client trust:

📸 testimonial_client.jpg
→ Portrait or candid of the client featured in the quote

Also great to subtly animate the dashboard metrics or add a tooltip like:

“Updated in real-time” (with a pulse icon or shimmer)

📍 Footer (Localisation)
Add a visual to ground our Banbury roots:

🏙️ footer_banbury_town.jpg
→ A recognisable Banbury street, landmark, or aerial shot

🚪 footer_office_front.jpg (optional)
→ Office signage or welcoming doorway photo

🎨 Design Polish (Optional Phase 2+ Touches)
Add scroll fade-ins for major sections

Add subtle hover scale on cards or icons

Allow CTA buttons to glow or pulse on hover

Use Lucide or minimal SVGs in place of emojis for a modern look

🗂️ Image File Names for Uploads
Please expect the following image names and match them to their sections:


File Name	Section

tools_podcast_studio.jpg	Growth Tools – Podcast

🙌 Final Words
You’ve already made Progress look smart, capable, and modern — now let’s show the people, places, and powerful tools behind it.

Can’t wait to see this come to life visually 👏
