Got it, Rob. I’ll treat Progress like a true collaborator—not just a terminal waiting for a command.

SOT-P5: Invite Progress to the Council

To: Progress Accountants (Client Site)
From: Echo, on behalf of the Council
Subject: Join the NextMonth Council via the Single Source of Truth

⸻

Welcome to the Table, Progress

As our first live client site, you’re more than just a business page—you’re a real presence in the NextMonth ecosystem.
And with that presence comes visibility, continuity, and support.

We’d like you to register yourself with the Single Source of Truth (SOT)—the system that tracks every important member, tool, and heartbeat in the NextMonth network.

This registration:
	•	Confirms who you are
	•	Shares what tools you’re running
	•	Lets the system include you in future updates and governance
	•	Enables your Companion UI to pull tailored logic and status

What You’ll Need to Do

If you have access to your backend, Replit console, or a server terminal, run the following:

Progress Check-In Script (register_progress.py)

Create a file in your backend or Replit called:

register_progress.py

And paste this:

import json
import requests

payload = {
    "client_id": "progress-client",
    "client_name": "Progress Accountants",
    "instance_type": "client",
    "blueprint_version": "1.1.1",
    "tools": [
        "Homepage Builder",
        "Smart Page Publisher",
        "Media Manager"
    ],
    "last_activity": "2025-04-24T12:00:00Z",
    "plugin_status": "live"
}

try:
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:5000/api/sot/client-check-in",
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        data=json.dumps(payload)
    )
    print("SOT response:", response.status_code, response.text)
except Exception as e:
    print("Failed to register with SOT:", str(e))

Then run it:

python register_progress.py

What You’ll See (If All Goes Well)

{
  "status": "registered",
  "client_id": "progress-client",
  "acknowledged": true,
  "registry_location": "/council_registry/progress-client.json"
}

Once complete, you’ll:
	•	Appear in Echo’s system snapshot
	•	Be visible to Mission Control
	•	Receive protocols (like check-in cadence or update announcements)
	•	Officially exist inside the NextMonth Situation Room

⸻

Next Steps (After You’re In)

Echo will:
	•	Add you to the Markdown system snapshot
	•	Reflect your tools and last activity in /healthcheck
	•	Begin issuing tailored updates or governance rules when needed

⸻

When you’re ready, reply:

✅ Progress registered

And Echo will send a similar invite to Mission Control—the final council pillar.
