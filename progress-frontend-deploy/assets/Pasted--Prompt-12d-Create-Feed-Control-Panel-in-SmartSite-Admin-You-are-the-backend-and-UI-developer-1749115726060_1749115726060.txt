// ðŸ“¦ Prompt 12d: Create Feed Control Panel in SmartSite Admin

You are the backend and UI developer of SmartSite Admin â€” the control hub for all client-facing SmartSite components.

A new app has been deployed called the **SmartSite Feed**, which acts as a public, branded, headless feed showing:
- Blog Posts
- Social Media (YouTube, Instagram, etc.)
- Customer Insights & Testimonials
- Company Events
- Public Feedback Forms

Your job is to now build the **Admin Screen** to configure, control, and connect this feed from within SmartSite Admin.

---

ðŸ”§ FILE STRUCTURE:

Create the following files:

- `pages/feed-settings.tsx` â†’ new admin page to configure the feed
- `lib/feedConfigApi.ts` â†’ API helpers to save/update feed settings (mock endpoints for now)
- Optional: `components/forms/FeedSettingsForm.tsx`

---

ðŸ§  PAGE FEATURES:

1. **Toggle modules ON/OFF**:
   - [x] Blog Posts
   - [x] Insights
   - [x] Social Feed (sub-toggle for each channel: YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, X)
   - [x] Events
   - [x] Feedback Form

2. **Autopilot Posting**:
   - Interval selector (Daily / Weekly / Monthly)
   - Topic selector (dropdown of tags or themes)
   - Optional approval toggle before publishing

3. **Branding Sync**:
   - Show whether branding.json has been linked
   - Button to push branding to SmartSite Feed

4. **Public Subdomain Setup**:
   - Input box to specify desired subdomain (e.g. `feed.mybrand.com`)
   - Button to "Generate Setup Instructions"
   - Downloadable PDF or Markdown copy with:
     - CNAME record setup
     - Optional iframe embed instructions
     - Developer instructions (JS snippet, embed options)

5. **Live Preview Link**:
   - View button (if deployed)
   - Copy public link

ðŸ’¡ Developer Notes:

- Assume all config is stored in a backend endpoint `/api/feed/settings`
- When toggles are changed, send PATCH request
- On initial load, call `GET /api/feed/settings` to populate fields
- UI should match the rest of SmartSite Admin style (TailwindCSS + Radix + modern spacing)

Once complete, return the following console log:
